# Video-Stabilization

This project involved replication of the video stabilization algorithm published in the following paper: https://www.cc.gatech.edu/cpl/projects/videostabilization/stabilization.pdf 

OpenCV, Numpy, and CVXPY were all used to replicate the algorithm. The results can be seen here

Due to honor code policy I have a private repo for this program which is available upon request.
